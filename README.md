# dnnf_go
Force-field to simulate aqueous graphene oxide (GO) and aqueous graphene interfaces with near DFT level accuracy

# Required software
1) Install deepmd-kit with lammps. GPU version is recommended. https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/getting-started/install.html
2) Make GO/graphene sheet. git clone https://github.com/velocirobbie/make-graphitics.git
3) Make GO-water system and equilibrate it for 1-2 ns.
4) Follow input example to use the forcefield for simulation
